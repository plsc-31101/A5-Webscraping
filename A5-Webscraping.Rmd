## Assignment 5

- __Assigned__: TBD.
- __Due__: TBD.

In this week's lecture, we introduced some tools to collect pieces of data from individual presidential documents. For this assignment, we will be looking at __all__ documents in the database that contain the string "space exploration." Our goals in this problem set are:

1. To scrape all documents returned from [this search query](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/advanced-search?field-keywords=%22space+exploration%22&field-keywords2=&field-keywords3=&from%5Bdate%5D=&to%5Bdate%5D=&person2=&items_per_page=100)

2. To organize this data into a dataframe and ultimately output a CSV file.

Below, I've given you the code for a function that passes the URL of an individual document, scrapes the information from that document, and returns this information in a list.

But this is all I will be providing you. You must complete the rest of the task yourself.

Specifically, you should:

1. Write code that scrapes all documents, organizes the information in a dataframe, and writes a csv file.

2. The end goal should be a dataset identical to the one I've provided for you in `data/space.csv`.

3. Split the code up into discrete steps, each with their own corresponding Rmarkdown chunk.

4. Document (i.e. describe) each step in clear but concise Rmarkdown prose.

5. The final chunk should:
  * print the structure (`str`) of the final data frame.
  * write the dataframe to a csv file. 

Onward!

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
library(stringr)
library(purrr)
library(lubridate)

scrape_docs <- function(URL){
  doc <- read_html(URL)

  speaker <- html_nodes(doc, ".diet-title a") %>% 
    html_text()
  
  date <- html_nodes(doc, ".date-display-single") %>%
    html_text() %>%
    mdy()
  
  title <- html_nodes(doc, "h1") %>%
    html_text()
  
  text <- html_nodes(doc, "div.field-docs-content") %>%
    html_text()
  
  all_info <- list(speaker = speaker, date = date, title = title, text = text)
  
  return(all_info)
}
```
